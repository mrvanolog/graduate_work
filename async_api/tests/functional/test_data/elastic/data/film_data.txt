In backyards, playgrounds, basements, and bedrooms, Star Wars toys helped kids re-enact scenes from their favorite movies, and create entirely new dangers for Luke Skywalker and his friends to face. They were lusted after on holidays and birthdays, swapped with great cunning out on the school yard, and carefully collected like fine treasures. Like no toys before them, the action figures, space ships, play sets, and props were a phenomenon that swept the nation with as much force as the film that inspired them. Along the way they transformed both the toy and movie industries, earned those behind them vast amounts of wealth, and ultimately created a hobby that, 30 years later, still holds sway over not only the people who grew up with the toys, but also an entirely new generation of fans. Plastic Galaxy is a documentary that explores the groundbreaking and breathtaking world of Star Wars toys.

Beyond the direct measures to have the league lift Invicta's suspension, its owner/president, Jos\\u00e9 Carlos Silva, believes another indirect measure is to win in the court of public opinion by currying favor with Philip Andrews, a British documentarian filming a movie about the feud, and whose cameras and stories he hopes will document that Invicta is the innocent victim. To curry that favor, Jos\\u00e9, upon Philip's expression of interest, is pushing his innocent daughter, In\\u00eas Silva, to date Philip, in who she truly has no interest despite Philip being a decent man. Meanwhile, one Castelo player not involved in that on-field incident is Brit Paul Collins, who was out sick that game and who is nursing a broken heart over a recent break-up with his girlfriend, Danielle. However, Paul and In\\u00eas fall in love at first sight when they spot each other across a crowded room at a party. Despite the obstacles, Paul and In\\u00eas do clandestinely see each other, with Carla, In\\u00eas' paternal grandmother, and Dr. Lawrence, Paul's American physician, reluctantly being their co-conspirators, reluctant in that they are more cognizant about a Paul/In\\u00eas relationship being fraught with life long problems. As Paul and In\\u00eas' love deepens, so does the feud, the two which truly may be incompatible.\"", "genres": [{"uuid": "0d6a523c-4b74-401f-923a-a7ac708e3a3a", "name": "drama"}, {"uuid": "3f667bf9-6c1f-44d6-b6a7-527f19c7597b", "name": "romance"}, {"uuid": "df95138f-52ec-4a49-a80f-7aa074f0f0ac", "name": "sport"}], "directors": [{"uuid": "f7be7550-6ea9-4f99-83da-86babbd234d0", "full_name": "Mark Heller"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "f7be7550-6ea9-4f99-83da-86babbd234d0", "full_name": "Mark Heller"}], "writers": [{"uuid": "f7be7550-6ea9-4f99-83da-86babbd234d0", "full_name": "Mark Heller"}]}

Borg Invasion 4D ran from 2004 to 2008. The audience enters a small theater where physically present actors portraying the Star Fleet crew greet them. The story is told through prerecorded 3D film sequences and actors' interaction with them and the audience. The story takes place some time after the end of the ST: Voyager series. The audience takes the roll of guests on a secret space station where Doctor from Voyager works with researches on creating a new DNA strain that will be resistant to the Borg's assimilation techniques. The guests are there to have themselves tested and help the research in case their DNA contains the resistant strain. Then the Borg attack. Actors lead the audience through a couple of hallways as other actors dressed as the Borg assimilate the researchers. Finally, the audience and the \\\"surviving\\\" actors reach another small theater that represents an escape shuttle and there a new series of prerecorded 3D film sequences starts. The shuttle launches but the Borg cube with the Queen inside captures it. As the Queen taunts the audience, the Borg are tearing the shuttle apart. Just as they are about to reach the audience, a familiar, charmingly raspy, friendly female voice is heard as well as the sound of proton torpedoes.

Men are considered mentally inferior and are divided into two categories: the \\\"adequately intelligent\\\" who are selected by women to act as their personal \\\"domestics\\\" for household chores, and the remainder who are forced to perform menial labor under the supervision of female guards.

The man is chosen as a domestic, sometimes is forced to work on a city maintenance crew, and the woman is assigned a white-collar job.

{"uuid": "99ee8f4b-f3d6-4e37-84ce-144376058840", "imdb_rating": 2.7, "title": "Joan Crawford: Always the Star", "description": "\"This glamorous and hugely popular actress raised herself from brutal poverty to Academy Award-winning stardom by guts, determination and hard work. During her fifty-year career, she made over eighty films. But her obsessive perfectionism led to the later caricature of coat-hanger-wielding harridan that even the adoration of fans could not counter. Still, she has endured as one of the most popular icons of the movies, an early role model to a million young women who aspired to her image of stylish magnetic power and unquestioned independence. She was born Lucille LeSueur on March 23, 1904 (or 1906) in San Antonio, Texas. Her father soon disappeared and she took the name of her stepfather, calling herself Billie Cassin. When Cassin, too, vanished, Billie did menial work to help her mother and brother survive. Ill-paid sales jobs bought dancing lessons and the clothes she needed to enter amateur contests. Then came a night-club contract as chorus girl - $25-a-week and eight routines a night. And so she made it into show-business, but the humiliations and insecurities of those early years would never entirely leave her. Spotted by an MGM scout, by 1925 she was under contract in Hollywood. She made the usual publicity appearaces and did Exhibition Dancing at night. Her vitality, charm and dancing talents earned her many admirers - including some powerful enough to advance her career, like William Haines, Paul Bern, Jackie Coogan, Sr. and Louis B. Mayer. After bit parts and a small role in the film Pretty Ladies, a studio-sponsored competition found her the name she at first hated: Joan Crawford. As Crawford's acting skills developed, she became known for her independence and her resilience despite some less-than-successful roles. Her vaguely pretty and plump early looks were soon replaced by the svelte, hard-boiled beauty of hollow-cheeks, thick brows and overpainted mouth that would be her permanent image. Her capacity to inspire and wear with flair the creations of the dress designer Adrian was legendary. But most of all, she was known for her hard work on the set. Joan Crawford's personal life was characterized equally by self-discipline and the determination to better herself, banishing forever her unhappy beginnings. Four husbands included actors Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, Franchot Tone, Phillip Terry and businessman Alfred Steele. Plagued by innumerable miscarriages, she adopted four children, one of whose account of Joan's unyielding perfectionism has succeded in blurring memories of the remarkable life and career of a Hollywood immortal. Among Joan Crawford's films from which clips are included: Sally, Irene and Mary, 1925; Our Dancing Daughters, 1928; Grand Hotel, 1932; Dancing Lady, 1933; The Gorgeous Hussy, 1936; The Women, 1939; A Woman's Face, 1941; Mildred Pierce, 1945; Humoresque, 1946; Possessed, 1947; Sudden Fear, 1952; Johnny Guitar, 1954 Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? 1962 and Strait Jacket, 1964.\"", "genres": [{"uuid": "be51d68f-e5e0-4283-8f2e-4677024b8807", "name": "documentary"}], "directors": [{"uuid": "710c2adb-483d-4b7b-9e84-47b984d3f73e", "full_name": "Suzette Winter"}, {"uuid": "9fee2053-4806-4254-959c-adb40a904a2d", "full_name": "Gene Feldman"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "710c2adb-483d-4b7b-9e84-47b984d3f73e", "full_name": "Suzette Winter"}, {"uuid": "9fee2053-4806-4254-959c-adb40a904a2d", "full_name": "Gene Feldman"}], "writers": [{"uuid": "710c2adb-483d-4b7b-9e84-47b984d3f73e", "full_name": "Suzette Winter"}, {"uuid": "9fee2053-4806-4254-959c-adb40a904a2d", "full_name": "Gene Feldman"}]}

In the four years that follow there is no question that rapping has brought Priscilla closer to her estranged father, and that her success has made him proud. Before our eyes, this father-daughter duo go from a one-bedroom shelter in Harlem to a 4 bedroom apartment, from food stamps to shopping sprees, from rapping on street corners to sold out night clubs, and from sneaking under train turnstiles without the $2 fare to spare to being driven around in tinted SUV's. It is further undeniable that Jesse has been reborn, from looking at old photos and bitterly reflecting on how he never was given the respect he deserved in the music business as a rapper himself to finding his own voice and self-respect as his daughter's overzealous manager. But in the efforts to make her dad proud, Priscilla struggles to remain a child and finds herself trapped in a world of people twice her size and four times her age and doesn't know who to trust. Jesse himself is caught between wanting to protect his daughter' innocence and exploiting her raw talent to fulfill his deferred dream.

The Russian filmmaker, Pavel Klusjantsev, has had an extraordinary influence on an entire genre of films. Throughout his career at the film studio in St. Petersburg, Klushantsev pioneered and invented legendary techniques for filming the planets, stars and weightnessless - long before anyone else. He went on to redefine the science fiction genre and influence the way Hollywood made their science fiction films, including the Academy Award-winning Visual Effects Master, Robert Skotak, a man who spent years trying to track Klushantsev down. This is a film about a fantastic inventor and dreamer whose destiny was intimately linked with the Space Race and the whims of the Soviet dictatorship. However, despite dying blind and penniless, Klushantsev has left an indelible mark on the history of film and inspired countless filmmakers.

Jyn: The Rebel: A closer look at the film's main protagonist: personality, character history and what separates her from other protagonists from the Star Wars universe, physical preparations for the shoot, and more. Cassian: The Spy: Much the same as the previous supplement in terms of introducing the character and his history, the qualities the character brings to the story, and casting Diego Luna. K-2SO: The Droid: A look at the robotic character: his \\\"anti C-3PO personality,\\\" character design, Alan Tudyk's motion capture performance, and the humor the actor brought to the set. Baze and Chirrut: Guardians of the Whills: The actors discuss landing and accepting the roles, the characters' camaraderie, individual character details, faith and the force in the movie and the Star Wars universe, and the actors' physical performances. Bodhi and Saw: The Pilot and The Revolutionary: The piece begins with Riz Ahmed's auditions and crafting the character, the character's fate, and making key sequences. It moves on to examine Forest Whitaker's character and his history in the Star Wars universe, character definition and history, Whitaker's preparations for the role, and more. The Empire: A run through of key Imperial characters, including Galen Erso, Orson Krennic, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Darth Vader and the qualities (and in Vader's case, the presence) their actors brought to their roles. Visions of Hope: The Look of Rogue One: Designing a world that's true and familiar to the Star Wars universe but still unique to the film. It explores set construction, small design changes, and the black stormtroopers. The Princess and The Governor: Digitally recreating two important characters. Epilogue: The Story Continues (1080p, 4:15): Images from the film's premiere juxtaposed against fans talking up the film and the franchise. The piece ends with a selection of clips from the film.\"", "genres": [{"uuid": "be51d68f-e5e0-4283-8f2e-4677024b8807", "name": "documentary"}], "directors": [{"uuid": "12a5d11e-645f-43ca-8937-b458cc2874d4", "full_name": "Glen Milner"}, {"uuid": "df80751e-6af3-42cc-8e0f-f1ae599ede01", "full_name": "Ian Bucknole(Co-Director)"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "12a5d11e-645f-43ca-8937-b458cc2874d4", "full_name": "Glen Milner"}, {"uuid": "df80751e-6af3-42cc-8e0f-f1ae599ede01", "full_name": "Ian Bucknole(Co-Director)"}], "writers": [{"uuid": "12a5d11e-645f-43ca-8937-b458cc2874d4", "full_name": "Glen Milner"}, {"uuid": "df80751e-6af3-42cc-8e0f-f1ae599ede01", "full_name": "Ian Bucknole(Co-Director)"}]}

Mary persuades Proctor, a big theatrical manager, to book the act, and they are a big hit. Then Larry and his publicity agent, \\\"Speed\\\" King, launch a big publicity stunt---a talent train in which they travel across country holding auditions for young performers. Back in New York, Carlotta Salvini, an ex-OPera singer, brings in her talented fourteen-year-old-daughter, Jane, who has an amazing voice. Larry, to get the mother out of the way, offers Carlotta a forty-week vaudeville tour, and then goes to work to make a star out of Jane, by building Braodway's first all-kiddie musical revue around her. Opening night has \\\"School Days\\\" as the first act and the show and Jane are a big hit...until the Gerry Society, organized to protect working children, reminds Larry there is a law against children working after 10 p m., and the show closes.

While the Castro brothers face their certain end, an uncertain future hangs over the island. Some people are afraid, many cannot wait, but all shudder and hope that the changes will be positive. This documentary leads the audience through the discovery of this hope, through a tourist's camera which looks to be turned off and oblivious to the conversation at hand, yet is focused on candidly capturing each person's wishes. There is the old guerrillero who took part in the revolution, the lady who met Che Guevara and lives thanks to the government social card, and also the young boys and girls - those who wish to make a career within the rules, as well as those who only try to escape abroad. Clandestine underground shops, businessmen experienced in all things illegal, dodgy pimps, mothers who force their daughters into selling their bodies - the hidden face of the State which welcomes tourists into its luxury resorts is openly displayed beyond censorship's control. One special guide is Yoani Sanchez, the independent blogger, a leader of the new, peaceful revolution - the revolution of ideas. The internet is its main instrument, while the government attempts to limit computer use with any means possible in a pushing and pulling of ideals. In the interview, recorded in a secret location, the young writer speaks about her country's ruin, and where Raul's reforms have no effect on everyday life. Castro's supporters and dissidents, young and old - none deceive themselves that the star of the revolution will shine on for much longer. And this is what this project focuses on: the wishes on a falling star.\"", "genres": [{"uuid": "15386d2f-992b-4dad-9351-6a929d1da413", "name": "news"}, {"uuid": "89fb5542-df68-4914-8829-348dd246addd", "name": "history"}, {"uuid": "be51d68f-e5e0-4283-8f2e-4677024b8807", "name": "documentary"}], "directors": [{"uuid": "08a96da1-4967-41f1-a3d1-23c4153720fa", "full_name": "Giammarco Sicuro"}, {"uuid": "955f2519-9474-4fc9-bc9a-7ff81e7c31b5", "full_name": "Jacopo Cecconi"}, {"uuid": "ba13e959-768e-4aff-9fb1-fa1c278b129b", "full_name": "Paolo Cellammare"}], "actors": [{"uuid": "08a96da1-4967-41f1-a3d1-23c4153720fa", "full_name": "Giammarco Sicuro"}, {"uuid": "955f2519-9474-4fc9-bc9a-7ff81e7c31b5", "full_name": "Jacopo Cecconi"}, {"uuid": "ba13e959-768e-4aff-9fb1-fa1c278b129b", "full_name": "Paolo Cellammare"}], "writers": [{"uuid": "08a96da1-4967-41f1-a3d1-23c4153720fa", "full_name": "Giammarco Sicuro"}, {"uuid": "955f2519-9474-4fc9-bc9a-7ff81e7c31b5", "full_name": "Jacopo Cecconi"}, {"uuid": "ba13e959-768e-4aff-9fb1-fa1c278b129b", "full_name": "Paolo Cellammare"}]}
